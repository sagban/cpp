You are given an integer n and a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'. Consider a string t=s+s+⋯+sn times, i.e. the string obtained by concatenating n copies of s.

Find the number of non-empty prefixes of t in which the number of occurrences of 'a' is strictly greater than the number of occurrences of 'b'.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains the string s and the integer n, separated by a single space.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid prefixes.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤|s|≤103
1≤n≤109
each character of s is either 'a' or 'b'
