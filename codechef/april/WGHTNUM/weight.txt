VK gave a problem to Chef, but Chef is too lazy, so he asked you to solve the problem for him. The statement of the problem follows.

Consider an integer with N digits (in decimal notation, without leading zeroes) D1,D2,D3,…,DN. Here, D1 is the most significant digit and DN the least significant. The weight of this integer is defined as
∑i=2N(Di−Di−1).
You are given integers N and W. Find the number of positive integers with N digits (without leading zeroes) and weight equal to W. Compute this number modulo 109+7.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and W denoting the number of digits and the required weight.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of N-digit positive integers with weight W, modulo 109+7.
